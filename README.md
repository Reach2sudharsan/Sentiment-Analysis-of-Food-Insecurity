## Abstract
There exists a lot of food insecurity around the world in the form of food deserts, places that have limited or no access to food. Many underprivileged and minority communities around the world suffer from a lack of food and resources. Though many organizations are trying to tackle global food insecurity, not much progress has really been made. Sentiment Analysis is a highly potential solution. With this, we can understand how different communities feel about the food they have access to. This paper then discusses performing the Sentiment Analysis using Deep Learning techniques and the programming language Python. I used the BiLSTM (Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory) model in order to analyze over 200 tweets from Twitter related to food deserts. The BiLSTM model used in this research was trained with IMDB movie reviews and their sentiments. After testing the model on the tweets, I produced word clouds as well as graphs showing clusters of words and frequency of common words, respectively.
